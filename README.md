password generator

In this assignment I wanted to create a responsive webpage that generates a password on screen.
I introduced checkboxes that gives you options on which characters you would like to include or not include in the result.
When you select Numbers, it will output numbers in the return at random.
When you select Uppercase, it will output uppercase letters in the return at random.
When you select Lowercase, it will output lowercase letters in the return at random.
When you select Special characters, it will output special characters in the return at random.
You also need to give the length of the password you are wanting to generate by entering a number between 8 and 128.
By default, all boxes are checked. Uncheck the boxes to remove that character type from the password result.
Press the Generate password button to return a random password in the area above.
Web page should also be responsive on mobile devices.
